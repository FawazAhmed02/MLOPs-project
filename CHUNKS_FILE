  "processed by simply tapping the card on a merchants payment terminal instead of swipe and\nsignature on receipt.\nAre NFC cards secured?\nNFC card transactions are processed through the same secured networks used for Visa and\nMasterCard transactions. You never lose sight of your card while each transaction has a unique,\nencrypted code that changes every time the card is used.\nWhat are the security features of NFC card?\nBelow are some of the security features available on NFC Debit Card:",
  "Short Range\n:\t\nThe card only works within short range of a merchant terminal, which makes it difficult for fraudsters\nto gain access to card information from a distance.\nEncryption\n:",
  "NFC cards use much more secure international EMV chip standards and advanced cryptography.\nDuring a transaction, a unique encryption code is shared between the card and device which\nexpires after every transaction. If someone were able to get close enough to steal data from your\ncard, they would still be unable to use the encryption code as it would have been expired.\nLimited Information\n:\tOnly limited information is used in a Tap and Pay transaction like language preference, card",
  "number and other coding. Customers name, bank account number or the three-digit security code is\nnot transmitted during a transaction.\nTransaction Limit\n: To improve customer convenience and streamline the checkout process, contactless payments up\nto PKR 3,000 per transaction (limit may vary by bank) can be made without entering a PIN.\nTransactions exceeding this limit will require a PIN.\nHow do chip cards work?",
  "How do chip cards work?\nDuring a payment transaction, the chip performs cryptographic processing by assigning a unique\ncode to each transaction. This helps prevent the transaction data from being fraudulently reused.\nChip processing takes place only when the card is used at a chip-activated terminal.\nA chip terminal is a point-of-sale (POS) device or ATM that is able to process chip transactions.",
  "Instead of swiping your card, you insert it in a chip terminal and leave it in the terminal until the\ntransaction is complete. If a merchant does not have a chip terminal or if their chip terminal is not yet\nactivated, transactions will be processed by swiping the cards magnetic stripe just as they are\nprocessed today.\nMake sure you remove your card from the terminal before leaving the merchants premises! This is a\ncommon challenge people face when getting used to using a chip card.",
  "Do transactions using the chip take longer to process than magnetic stripe transactions?\nBoth chip and magnetic stripe card transactions are processed very quickly. Leaving your card\ninserted, versus swiping the card, does add a few seconds on to the transaction in order to assign\nthe unique code to your transaction. This is a step that does not exist with magnetic stripe only",
  "transactions; and, it is what adds the additional layer of security.\nAre all chip terminals the same?\nNo. There are several manufacturers and styles of chip terminals. However, all terminals perform\nthe same function of inserting the chip and assigning a unique code to each transaction.\nWill I still be required to sign for my debit card purchase?\nYou will be required to sign for all your debit card purchases. However some merchants may require",
  "you to enter your PIN to complete a transaction if the merchants terminal supports PIN entry.\nIs my card considered chip and signature or chip and PIN?\nBoth chip and signature' and chip and PIN refer to the way a card is authenticated at the terminal.\nYour card will be authenticated using chip and signature, which offers the same cryptographic\nsecurity as chip and PIN.\nCan I still swipe my card if I dont want to use the chip?",
  "Most merchant terminals will require the chip to be used if the terminal is enabled to accept chip\ntransactions. The terminal should prompt you to use your chip when it is a requirement. Using the\nchip is a more secure transaction method than magnetic stripe-only at point-of-sale, so this is the\npreferred method where merchants have enabled chip transactions.\nCan I use my chip card at an ATM?\nYes. At ATMs that are not chip-enabled, the transaction will be processed using your cards",
  "magnetic stripe technology in combination with your PIN. At ATMs equipped with chip readers, the\ntransaction will be processed using the chip technology in combination with your PIN.\nWhat type of fraud prevention is available with my card?\nWe take card security very seriously and have sophisticated fraud detection services in place:\n24/7 Fraud Monitoring  We always monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and attempt to\ncontact you when we see something out of the ordinary.",

  "processed by simply tapping the card on a merchants payment terminal instead of swipe and\nsignature on receipt.\nAre NFC cards secured?\nNFC card transactions are processed through the same secured networks used for Visa and\nMasterCard transactions. You never lose sight of your card while each transaction has a unique,\nencrypted code that changes every time the card is used.\nWhat are the security features of NFC card?\nBelow are some of the security features available on NFC Debit Card:",
  "Short Range\n:\t\nThe card only works within short range of a merchant terminal, which makes it difficult for fraudsters\nto gain access to card information from a distance.\nEncryption\n:",
  "NFC cards use much more secure international EMV chip standards and advanced cryptography.\nDuring a transaction, a unique encryption code is shared between the card and device which\nexpires after every transaction. If someone were able to get close enough to steal data from your\ncard, they would still be unable to use the encryption code as it would have been expired.\nLimited Information\n:\tOnly limited information is used in a Tap and Pay transaction like language preference, card",
  "number and other coding. Customers name, bank account number or the three-digit security code is\nnot transmitted during a transaction.\nTransaction Limit\n: To improve customer convenience and streamline the checkout process, contactless payments up\nto PKR 3,000 per transaction (limit may vary by bank) can be made without entering a PIN.\nTransactions exceeding this limit will require a PIN.\nHow do chip cards work?",
  "How do chip cards work?\nDuring a payment transaction, the chip performs cryptographic processing by assigning a unique\ncode to each transaction. This helps prevent the transaction data from being fraudulently reused.\nChip processing takes place only when the card is used at a chip-activated terminal.\nA chip terminal is a point-of-sale (POS) device or ATM that is able to process chip transactions.",
  "Instead of swiping your card, you insert it in a chip terminal and leave it in the terminal until the\ntransaction is complete. If a merchant does not have a chip terminal or if their chip terminal is not yet\nactivated, transactions will be processed by swiping the cards magnetic stripe just as they are\nprocessed today.\nMake sure you remove your card from the terminal before leaving the merchants premises! This is a\ncommon challenge people face when getting used to using a chip card.",
  "Do transactions using the chip take longer to process than magnetic stripe transactions?\nBoth chip and magnetic stripe card transactions are processed very quickly. Leaving your card\ninserted, versus swiping the card, does add a few seconds on to the transaction in order to assign\nthe unique code to your transaction. This is a step that does not exist with magnetic stripe only",
  "transactions; and, it is what adds the additional layer of security.\nAre all chip terminals the same?\nNo. There are several manufacturers and styles of chip terminals. However, all terminals perform\nthe same function of inserting the chip and assigning a unique code to each transaction.\nWill I still be required to sign for my debit card purchase?\nYou will be required to sign for all your debit card purchases. However some merchants may require",
  "you to enter your PIN to complete a transaction if the merchants terminal supports PIN entry.\nIs my card considered chip and signature or chip and PIN?\nBoth chip and signature' and chip and PIN refer to the way a card is authenticated at the terminal.\nYour card will be authenticated using chip and signature, which offers the same cryptographic\nsecurity as chip and PIN.\nCan I still swipe my card if I dont want to use the chip?",
  "Most merchant terminals will require the chip to be used if the terminal is enabled to accept chip\ntransactions. The terminal should prompt you to use your chip when it is a requirement. Using the\nchip is a more secure transaction method than magnetic stripe-only at point-of-sale, so this is the\npreferred method where merchants have enabled chip transactions.\nCan I use my chip card at an ATM?\nYes. At ATMs that are not chip-enabled, the transaction will be processed using your cards",

  "processed by simply tapping the card on a merchants payment terminal instead of swipe and\nsignature on receipt.\nAre NFC cards secured?\nNFC card transactions are processed through the same secured networks used for Visa and\nMasterCard transactions.

  "Short Range\n:\t\nThe card only works within short range of a merchant terminal, which makes it difficult for fraudsters\nto gain access to card information from a distance.\nEncryption\n:",
  "NFC cards use much more secure international EMV chip standards and advanced cryptography.\nDuring a transaction, a unique encryption code is shared between the card and device which\nexpires after every transaction. If someone were able to get close enough to steal data from your\ncard, they would still be unable to use the encryption code as it would have been expired.\nLimited Information\n:\tOnly limited information is used in a Tap and Pay transaction like language preference, card",
  "number and other coding. Customers name, bank account number or the three-digit security code is\nnot transmitted during a transaction.\nTransaction Limit\n: To improve customer convenience and streamline the checkout process, contactless payments up\nto PKR 3,000 per transaction (limit may vary by bank) can be made without entering a PIN.\nTransactions exceeding this limit will require a PIN.\nHow do chip cards work?",
  "How do chip cards work?\nDuring a payment transaction, the chip performs cryptographic processing by assigning a unique\ncode to each transaction. This helps prevent the transaction data from being fraudulently reused.\nChip processing takes place only when the card is used at a chip-activated terminal.\nA chip terminal is a point-of-sale (POS) device or ATM that is able to process chip transactions.",
  "Instead of swiping your card, you insert it in a chip terminal and leave it in the terminal until the\ntransaction is complete. If a merchant does not have a chip terminal or if their chip terminal is not yet\nactivated, transactions will be processed by swiping the cards magnetic stripe just as they are\nprocessed today.\nMake sure you remove your card from the terminal before leaving the merchants premises! This is a\ncommon challenge people face when getting used to using a chip card.",
  "Do transactions using the chip take longer to process than magnetic stripe transactions?\nBoth chip and magnetic stripe card transactions are processed very quickly. Leaving your card\ninserted, versus swiping the card, does add a few seconds on to the transaction in order to assign\nthe unique code to your transaction. This is a step that does not exist with magnetic stripe only",

However some merchants may require",
  "you to enter your PIN to complete a transaction if the merchants terminal supports PIN entry.\nIs my card considered chip and signature or chip and PIN?\nBoth chip and signature' and chip and PIN refer to the way a card is authenticated at the terminal.\nYour card will be authenticated using chip and signature, which offers the same cryptographic\nsecurity as chip and PIN.\nCan I still swipe my card if I dont want to use the chip?",
  "Most merchant terminals will require the chip to be used if the terminal is enabled to accept chip\ntransactions. The terminal should prompt you to use your chip when it is a requirement. Using the\nchip is a more secure transaction method than magnetic stripe-only at point-of-sale, so this is the\npreferred method where merchants have enabled chip transactions.\nCan I use my chip card at an ATM?\nYes.

  "Rights & liabilities of Owner v/s User\nAn Islamic Ijarah is an asset-based contract, i.e. the Lessor should have ownership of the asset\nduring the period of the contract. Under Islamic Shariah, all ownership related rights and liabilities\nshould lie with the owner while all usage-related rights and liabilities should lie with the user.A",
  "conventional lease contract does not distinguish between the nature of these liabilities and places all\nliabilities on the user of the asset, which is contradictory to Islamic Shariah. Under Ijarah, all\nownership-related risks lie with the Bank while all usage related risks lie with the user, thus making\nthe Lessor the true owner of the asset and making the income generated through the contract\npermissible (Halal) for the Bank.",
  "permissible (Halal) for the Bank.\nContinuation of lease rentals in case of total loss or theft of vehicle\nIf the leased vehicle is stolen or completely destroyed, the conventional leasing company continues\ncharging the lease rent till the settlement of the Insurance claim. Under the Islamic system, rent is\nconsideration for usage of the leased asset, and if the asset has been stolen or destroyed, the\nconcept of rental becomes void. As such, in the above-mentioned eventualities, Meezan bank does",
  "not charge the lease rental.\nTakaful instead of Insurance\nLegally (in accordance to Pakistans Law and Regulations), it is required for all leasing entities to\ninsure the leased assets. As such, Meezan Bank insures its leased assets. Meezan Bank insures its\nassets through Takaful only, which is the Islamic product for insurance.\nPermissibility for Penalty of Late Payment of Rent under Islamic Shariah",
  "In most contemporary financial leases, an extra monetary amount is charged, in their income, if the\nrent is not paid on time. This extra amount is the considered as Riba and is Haram. Under Ijarah, the\nLessee may be asked to undertake, that if he fails to pay rent on its due date, he will pay certain\namount to a charity, which will be administered through the Islamic Bank. For this purpose the bank\nmaintains a charity fund where such amounts may be credited and disbursed for charitable purpose.",
